# Getting Started with AstraUI 🚀

## Installation

```bash
npm install astra-ui-kit @types/styled-components @types/styled-system
```

or if you prefer using yarn:

```bash
yarn add astra-ui-kit @types/styled-components @types/styled-system
```

## Example Usage

Here is a basic usage example:

```tsx
import { Button, Box } from "astra-ui-kit";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Box>
      <Button>Test Button</Button>
    </Box>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, we import the `Button` component from the Astra UI Kit and use it in our `App` component.

We are currently working on a comprehensive documentation to provide you with detailed information on each component and usage examples.
