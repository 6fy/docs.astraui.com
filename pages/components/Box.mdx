The `Box` component is a foundational component in the Astra UI Kit. It is a flexible and extensible container for nesting, alignment, and layout. It is equipped with space and color utility functions from Styled System, allowing for extensive customization.

## Usage

import { Box } from "astra-ui-kit";

<Box
  sx={{
    height: "100px",
    width: "100px",
  }}
  bg="primary"
  color="white"
  display="flex"
  alignItems="center"
  backgroundColor="red"
  justifyContent="center"></Box>

## Properties

### `children` : ReactNode

Defines the elements or components to be enclosed within the `Box`.

### `color` : string

Sets the color of the `Box`. Accepts any valid CSS color value.

### `...rest` : object

The `Box` component supports all properties of an HTMLDivElement, and all ColorProps and SpaceProps from Styled System. This ensures that the `Box` can adapt its style and behavior to your specific needs.

## Styled System Props

The `Box` component includes support for `space` and `color` utilities from Styled System. This means you can apply space (margin and padding) and color values directly to your components.

## Pseudo-class States

The `Box` component also offers support for CSS pseudo-classes, such as `_hover`, `_focus`, `_active`, and `_disabled`. With these pseudo-classes, you can define how the `Box` should look and behave under certain states or user interactions.

## Accessibility

Accessibility is a key consideration in the design of the `Box` component. To ensure your application is accessible, always provide meaningful `alt` texts for images and adequate color contrast ratios as per WCAG guidelines.

## Performance

The `Box` component is optimized for performance. By leveraging React's virtual DOM, it ensures efficient updates and rendering, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
