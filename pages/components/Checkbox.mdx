The `Checkbox` component in the Astra UI Kit is a wrapper around the HTML input checkbox, but with an enhanced appearance and additional customization options.

## Usage

import { Checkbox } from "astra-ui-kit";

<Checkbox />

## Properties

### `disabled` : boolean

Determines whether the `Checkbox` is disabled.

### `colorScheme` : "purple" | "green" | "red" | "orange" | "yellow" | DefaultColorKey

Sets the color scheme for the `Checkbox` when checked.

### `...rest` : object

The `Checkbox` component supports all properties of an HTMLInputElement, ensuring full flexibility for various needs.

## Styling

The `Checkbox` uses a color scheme handler to set the `accent-color` property when the checkbox is checked, allowing for a variety of visual options.

## Accessibility

The `Checkbox` component is compliant with WCAG guidelines, ensuring that your application remains accessible to all users. However, make sure to provide proper labeling to the checkbox to help screen reader users.

## Performance

The `Checkbox` component, like all components in the Astra UI Kit, is optimized for performance. It minimizes re-renders and leverages the virtual DOM for efficient updates.
