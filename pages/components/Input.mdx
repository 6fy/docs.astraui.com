## Styling

The `Input` uses a styled div container for managing the layout and appearance of the input and its associated icons.

## Pseudo-class States

The `Input` component has support for the `_hover`, `_focus`, `_active`, and `_disabled` pseudo-classes. This allows you to define how the `Input` should look and behave under certain states or user interactions.
