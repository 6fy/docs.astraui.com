## Usage

<Stack spacingX="10px" backgroundColor="grey" p="10px">
  <Button>Button 1</Button>
  <Button>Button 2</Button>
</Stack>

## Styled System Props

The `Stack` component can use styled-system functions for color, space, size, grid, layout, and flexbox. Styled-system props allow you to adjust the component to fit various design requirements.

## Pseudo-class States
